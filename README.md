  Hurdles Overcome
</h4> -->

<!-- - **Integration with Real-time Data**: Initially, synchronizing the platform's real-time feed with the vast and dynamic data sources posed a challenge. Through collaboration and persistent debugging, we refined our data-fetching algorithms to ensure seamless updates.
  
- **Custom Map Interface**: Designing an integrated map interface that was intuitive and user-friendly took several iterations and user feedback sessions. The final result was a blend of performance and aesthetics.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the platform was equally effective across devices was challenging, given the variety of interactive elements. We utilized SCSS and regular cross-device testing to achieve this.

- **Diverse Technologies**: Integrating a plethora of modern web technologies, from GraphQL to CI/CD pipelines, required a steep learning curve and rigorous testing. Yet, the end product stands as a testament to our commitment and persistence.
